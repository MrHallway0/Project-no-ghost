# Project-no-ghost
This codenamed project is intended to create a FOSS web client for Minecraft so users can connect to servers and chat/AFK. I do not want this software to be sold but I am still putting it under the MIT License so you can do what ever you want as I do not agree with the GNU License for how it lacks things like comercial use.
